# Internal training
We are conducting internal training for members who have just joined the Center for Computational Biology. The spirit of this training is to make sure that we are on the same page i.e., before new members engage in project activities, we would like to make sure they have the necessary skills at least to get started or get going. So, the training is intended to bring them up to speed or rather as a refresher for those who are already familiar with the work that we do or ought to do.

The training schedule is as follows: Friday July 3rd 11am to 12pm: Introduction to R programming; Friday July 10th 11am to 12pm: Statistics primer; Friday July 17th 11am to 12pm: Introduction to epidemic modeling; Friday July 24rd 11am to 12pm: Introduction to molecular biology; Friday 31st July 11am to 12pm: Navigating and making use of scientific literature; Friday 3rd August 11am to 12pm: Grant writing 101; Friday 10th August 11am to 12pm: Introduction to Unix.
